# Leetcode POTD Solutions

Welcome to my Leetcode Problem of the Day (POTD) solutions repository! Here, I will be posting and pushing my daily solutions to the Leetcode POTD challenges, organized month-wise.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each month. Each directory contains the daily solutions for that month.

```
Leetcode-POTD/
├── 2024/

│   │   ├── Question Title.cpp
│   │   ├── Question2 Title.cpp
│   │   └── ...

```

## How to Use

1. **Browse Solutions**: Navigate to the appropriate month directory to find solutions for each day.
2. **View Solutions**: Open the `.md` file corresponding to the date you are interested in. Each file contains the problem statement and my solution in the language used (most likely Python, C++, or Java).
